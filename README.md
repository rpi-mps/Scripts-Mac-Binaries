RPI Microprocessor Systems Repository for STM32F769I-Discovery Kit: Mac Build Scripts and Backend Folder

This repository contains the Mac build scripts themselves, as well as the Mac Backend folder. In order to open the archive, you'll need a file compression utility like 7-zip. Just opening the .001 file with the utility when all the archive's parts are in one folder will then open the whole archive. The split has been done to keep file sizes manageable.
