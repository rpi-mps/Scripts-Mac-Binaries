# Scripts-Mac-Binaries
Mac Compile Scripts and Backend folder for RPI Microprocessor Systems using the STM32F769I-Discovery kit.

This repository contains the Mac compile scripts environment, as well as the Mac-specific Backend folder. In order to open the archive, you'll need a file compression utility like Keka. Just opening the .001 file with the utility when all of the archive's parts are in one folder will then open the whole archive. The split was necessary to keep file sizes manageable.
